        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
         appointment at Stanford, 
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been 
        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. 
        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a 
        special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
      </p>

      <p>
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to 
        pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and 
        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>

      <p>
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning 
            of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, 
            a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples 
            in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently
             apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought 
             smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it 
            could ever be proved.
        </p>
         <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark 
            energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and 
            energy to science and speculation.
        </p>  
        <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its 
            hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture 
            and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes 
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
